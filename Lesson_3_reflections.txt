When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would want to use a remote repository if I wanted to share my work that I'm proud of with others online. Also, I would definitely want to use a remote repository if I am working with others on a project. Using the remote repository would let me invite others to collaborate with me, giving them access to view and contribute to it. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
